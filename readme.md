# 🚀 0-1 Dev Docker Learning Roadmap  

This roadmap will take you from **Docker fundamentals** to **advanced-level usage** in production systems. Each phase includes **key topics, hands-on tasks, real-world applications, common pitfalls, and best practices**. The goal is not just theoretical learning but **practical mastery**.  

---

## 📌 Phase 1: Introduction to Docker & Containerization  

### 🔹 Goal  
Understand the core concepts of containers and Docker's role in software development.  

### ✅ Key Topics  
- What is Containerization?  
- Docker vs. Virtual Machines  
- Installing Docker (Windows/Linux/Mac)  
- Basic Docker Architecture: Client, Daemon, Images, Containers  
- Running Your First Docker Container (`docker run`)  
- Understanding Docker CLI commands (`docker ps`, `docker stop`, `docker rm`)  

### 🛠 Hands-on Tasks/Projects  
- Install Docker on your machine.  
- Run `hello-world` and analyze how Docker pulls and executes images.  
- Explore basic Docker commands (`run`, `ps`, `stop`, `rm`).  
- Run a simple Ubuntu container (`docker run -it ubuntu bash`) and explore the file system.  

### ⚠ Common Pitfalls & Debugging Tips  
- **"Docker command not found"** – Ensure Docker is installed and the daemon is running.  
- **Permission issues** – Run commands with `sudo` or add yourself to the `docker` group.  

### 🌍 Best Practices & Real-World Use Cases  
- Use Docker for **isolated development environments**.  
- Avoid running **unnecessary privileged containers** for security.  

### ⏭ Next Steps  
Proceed to **Phase 2: Docker Images & Dockerfiles** after mastering these basics.  

---

## 📌 Phase 2: Docker Images & Dockerfiles  

### 🔹 Goal  
Learn how Docker images work and how to create custom images.  

### ✅ Key Topics  
- What are Docker images?  
- Difference between **containers** and **images**  
- Pulling and exploring images from **Docker Hub**  
- Writing a **Dockerfile** (base images, layers, commands)  
- Building and tagging custom images (`docker build`)  
- Understanding **layers & caching** for efficient builds  

### 🛠 Hands-on Tasks/Projects  
- Pull and explore an official image from Docker Hub (`docker pull node`).  
- Create a **custom Docker image** for a simple Python or Node.js application.  
- Optimize a Dockerfile by reducing image size using **smaller base images** (e.g., `alpine`).  

### ⚠ Common Pitfalls & Debugging Tips  
- **Huge image size?** Use a smaller base image (`alpine`, `buster-slim`).  
- **Dockerfile syntax errors?** Use `docker build --no-cache` to troubleshoot.  

### 🌍 Best Practices & Real-World Use Cases  
- Use **minimal base images** for security and efficiency.  
- **Tag your images properly** (`latest` isn’t always the best choice).  

### ⏭ Next Steps  
Move to **Phase 3: Managing Containers & Networking** after mastering image building.  

---

## 📌 Phase 3: Managing Containers & Networking  

### 🔹 Goal  
Understand how to **run, manage, and network multiple containers**.  

### ✅ Key Topics  
- Starting, stopping, and restarting containers  
- Running containers in **detached mode** (`-d`)  
- Container logs and debugging (`docker logs`, `docker exec`)  
- **Docker Networking**: Bridge, Host, Overlay, None  
- Linking containers using **Docker networks**  
- Exposing ports (`-p 8080:80`)  

### 🛠 Hands-on Tasks/Projects  
- Run an **Nginx container** and access it via localhost (`docker run -d -p 8080:80 nginx`).  
- Create a **custom network** and run two containers that communicate.  
- Use `docker logs` and `docker exec` to debug a running container.  

### ⚠ Common Pitfalls & Debugging Tips  
- **Can’t access a container’s port?** Ensure it's exposed (`-p 8080:80`).  
- **Networking issues?** Use `docker network ls` to check networks.  

### 🌍 Best Practices & Real-World Use Cases  
- Use **named networks** instead of default bridges for **multi-container apps**.  
- Avoid **exposing all ports** unless necessary for security.  

### ⏭ Next Steps  
Proceed to **Phase 4: Docker Compose & Multi-Container Applications** after mastering networking.  

---

## 📌 Phase 4: Docker Compose & Multi-Container Applications  

### 🔹 Goal  
Learn to **manage multi-container applications** efficiently.  

### ✅ Key Topics  
- Introduction to **Docker Compose** (`docker-compose.yml`)  
- Defining **services, volumes, and networks**  
- **Scaling applications** with Compose  
- **Environment variables** in Compose  
- **Restart policies** (`always`, `unless-stopped`)  

### 🛠 Hands-on Tasks/Projects  
- Set up a **Node.js + MongoDB stack** using Docker Compose.  
- Define a **WordPress + MySQL setup** with Compose.  

### ⚠ Common Pitfalls & Debugging Tips  
- **Compose file indentation errors?** Validate with `docker-compose config`.  
- **Service fails on restart?** Check logs using `docker-compose logs`.  

### 🌍 Best Practices & Real-World Use Cases  
- Use **.env files** to manage environment variables securely.  
- Define dependencies properly using `depends_on`.  

### ⏭ Next Steps  
Move to **Phase 5: Volumes, Storage & Persistent Data** after mastering Compose.  

---

## 📌 Phase 5: Volumes, Storage & Persistent Data  

### 🔹 Goal  
Learn how to **persist data** in containers.  

### ✅ Key Topics  
- Understanding **Docker Volumes**  
- **Bind Mounts vs Named Volumes**  
- Using volumes in **Docker Compose**  
- **Backing up and restoring volumes**  

### 🛠 Hands-on Tasks/Projects  
- Create and manage a **PostgreSQL container** with persistent storage.  
- Backup and restore database data between containers.  

### ⚠ Common Pitfalls & Debugging Tips  
- **Lost data after container restart?** Use **named volumes**, not just bind mounts.  

### 🌍 Best Practices & Real-World Use Cases  
- **Always use volumes** for databases to **prevent data loss**.  

### ⏭ Next Steps  
Proceed to **Phase 6: Docker Security & Best Practices** after mastering storage.

## 📌 Phase 6: Docker Security & Best Practices  

### 🔹 Goal  
Secure Docker containers and follow **industry best practices**.  

### ✅ Key Topics
